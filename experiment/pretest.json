      "explanation": "<p>An operational amplifier (op-amp) possesses several ideal characteristics that define its performance. It has a very high input impedance (differential or common-mode), ideally infinite, and a very low output impedance in open-loop configuration, ideally zero. The voltage gain of an op-amp is extremely high, ideally infinite, allowing it to amplify even minute input differences. It exhibits a very low common-mode voltage gain, ideally zero, meaning the output remains at zero when both inputs are at the same voltageâ€”this is known as zero offset voltage. Additionally, the output of an ideal op-amp can change instantaneously, reflecting an infinite slew rate. The bias current in an op-amp is designed to support these ideal characteristics, resulting in high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), high differential gain, and high input impedance.</p>",
